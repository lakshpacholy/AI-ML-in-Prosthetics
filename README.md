## Overview

**AI-ML-in-Prosthetics** aims to bridge the gap between machine learning research and real-world prosthetic systems. The repository demonstrates how AI/ML techniques can be employed to:
- Analyze signals (such as EMG or kinematic data) for prosthetic control
- Classify user intentions or movements
- Optimize prosthetic device performance and adaptability
- Personalize prosthetic solutions to individual users
